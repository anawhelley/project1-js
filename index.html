                    Changing States: Make a website that&apos;s principle focus is on the changing between states. The states you choose can be a binary (day vs. night, messy vs. clean, wet vs. dry, hot vs. cold etc.) or exist more on a spectrum (the spectrum of color, temperature, wealth, sound volume, emotion etc.).

                    Generative Tool: In this project, you will create your own tool using programming concepts like variables, loops, and conditionals. Just like the tools mentioned as examples, your tool will take some form of user input as material and transform it into a visual output. We will look at examples together in class.
